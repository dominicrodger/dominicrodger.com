Two years on, and I still love the combination of
[tox](http://tox.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) and
[Travis](https://www.dominicrodger.com/2012/04/29/build-breaking/). I
still write changes to my `tox.ini` and `.travis.yml` files
separately, despite having [written a tool for
this](https://www.dominicrodger.com/2013/07/26/tox-and-travis/). It
occurred to me yesterday that there was a better way of writing this
now - since tox now has a command for listing out what environments
are set up (something which I think didn't exist when I wrote the
original Python script).

<!-- more -->

My original tool was used a bit like this:

```
python tox2travis.py > .travis.yml
```

Rewritten in bash, it now looks like this:

```
#!/bin/bash
set -o nounset
set -o errexit
command -v tox >/dev/null 2>&1 || { echo >&2 "tox2travis requires tox but it's not installed. Aborting."; exit 1; }

if [ ! -f tox.ini ]; then
     echo "tox.ini not found. Aborting."
     exit 1
fi

echo "language: python"
echo "python: 2.7"
echo "env:"
for env in $(tox -l); do
     echo "  - TOX_ENV=${env}"
done
echo "install:" echo "  - pip install tox"
echo "script:" echo "  - tox -e $TOX_ENV"
```

This is functionally pretty identical (though a little better at
error checking) to my previous effort, but is a good deal neater, and
doesn't depend on tox internals.

I've also set it up so that it's on my path, which is the main
(stupid) reason why I never really got used to using the old version.
