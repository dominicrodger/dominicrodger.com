I've been getting tired of keeping my WordPress plugins up to date
for the sake of some very old blog posts, so I figured it was time I
switched back to a static site generator. Last time I did this, I
used [Pelican](/2012/04/07/starting-with-pelican/), this time around
I've picked [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), mostly for the chance to play
with a shiny new thing.

Migration wasn't very complicated - I got most the way there by
exporting my WordPress site as an XML file, and then [this
repo](https://github.com/wooni005/exitwp-for-hugo) did most the heavy
lifting. After that, some manual tweaking was needed to make
everything look reasonable (fixing up footnote rendering, etc), and
manually re-tagging everything to organise content a bit, and I was
done. All told - it took probably a couple of hours, but I'm pretty
happy to be back to a simpler place.

Check back in a couple of years before I've got the itch to redo it
all again, at which point no doubt my next post will appear.
