title: Bulk Upgrading Django Sites
slug: upgrading-django

A [new version of
Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/weblog/2013/mar/28/django-151/)
was released a couple of days ago. I'm currently at 11 sites using
Django, so upgrading them all manually (which I did last time) is a
pain.

To help me out, I wrote a tiny [Fabric](http://www.fabfile.org)
script to spin through my sites, check if they're using the version
of Django that was upgraded, and if they are, upgrade them.

## Simple Sites


It's worth noting that this only works because all of my sites are
fairly low traffic, and I don't mind too much just taking them
offline for a minute or two. Also, they're all hosted on
[Webfaction](http://www.webfaction.com/?affiliate=dominicrodger), and
have very similar setups[^1].


## The code


We'll start off by looking at the actual command I run,
`upgrade_django`, which I run across all my Webfaction
accounts[^2].

```
def upgrade_django(from_version, to_version):
    apps = django_apps[env.host_string]
    for app in apps:
        version = get_django_version(app)
        if version == from_version:
            print ("Current version of Django for %s "
                   "is %s, upgrading to %s..."
                   % (app, version, to_version))
            upgrade_django_install(app, to_version)
        else:
            print ("Current version of Django for %s "
                   "is %s, no upgrade needed."
                   % (app, version))
```

To upgrade all Django 1.5 sites I have to 1.5.1, I run
`upgrade_django` like this:

```
fab upgrade_django:1.5,1.5.1
```

There are a few more bits you'll need to make this work - let's take
a look at the `get_django_version` code:

```
def get_django_version(app):
    with cd('~/webapps/%s/' % app):
        with hide('running', 'stdout'):
            with prefix('source env/bin/activate'):
                result = run('pip freeze | grep "^Django=="')
                django, version=result.split('==')
                return version
```

If the version `get_django_version` returns matches the version I'm
looking to upgrade, then we run `upgrade_django_install`, which is
just this:

```
def upgrade_django_install(app, version):
    with cd('~/webapps/%s/' % app):
        with prefix('source env/bin/activate'):
            run('pip install Django==%s' % version)
            run('apache2/bin/restart')
```

Never again will I have to do a Django upgrade ["by
hand"](https://twitter.com/dominicrodger/status/112520438617350145).

You can take a look at the full code on
[GitHub](https://gist.github.com/dominicrodger/5276253).

[^1]: They all have their virtualenv in `webapps/appname/env`, for
      example.

[^2]: Since I run sites for various organisations, most of them have
      their own Webfaction account.
