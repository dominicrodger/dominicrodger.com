I tried out [Fabric](http://fabfile.org) a while ago, but never
really got anywhere with it.

Time passed, and I forgot it existed, and wrote my simple scripts for
automating deployment of my various sites, using
[Paramiko](http://www.lag.net/paramiko/). It was incredibly tedious,
but meant I could deploy my sites from whatever computer I was on,
provided I had a checkout of my code.

Then I re-discovered Fabric, and realised I was about to throw away a
lot of code.

<!-- more -->

Deploying my sites now generally involves having Fabric installed in
my virtual environment, and a `fabfile.py` file locally which looks
something like this:

```
from fabric.api import env, run, cd, prefix, local
from fabric.colors import green

env.use_ssh_config = True # So I can use stuff from ~/.ssh/config
env.hosts = ['myhostname', ] # Hosts I want to run it on

def deploy():
    local('git push')
    with cd('~/webapps/cbm'), prefix('source env/bin/activate'):
        print(green("Updating code..."))
        run("git pull")

        print(green("Updating the database..."))
        run("python manage.py syncdb")
        run("python manage.py migrate")

        print(green("Collecting static files..."))
        run("python manage.py collectstatic --noinput")

        print(green("Restarting the server..."))
        run("apache2/bin/restart")
```

Now, when I get home after my [train
journey](https://www.dominicrodger.com/2012/07/09/ubuntu-netbook/), I
can just run `fab deploy`, and changes I've made on my way home are
automatically deployed. Best of all, on sites which use the same
codebase (of which I've got a few), I can just add a list of
hostnames to deploy to, and all the sites stay in sync.

I've also got Fabric files set up for Django upgrades, so whenever
there's a new version of Django out, I can now update all my sites
with one command[1. This is generally most useful for point releases,
such as for going from 1.4.2 to 1.4.3. Major upgrades (e.g. from 1.3
to 1.4) might require a bit more work, but I'd still do it all with
Fabric.].

Now I've written this, I'll publish this post with this site's
[fabfile](https://github.com/dominicrodger/dominicrodger.com/blob/master/fabfile.py).
