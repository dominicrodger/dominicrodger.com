I'm Dom - I'm a professional C++ programmer, Python dabbler, and
dad to four children.

This blog is mostly me occasionally writing up my experience of
[re-publishing this blog in another format](/tags/blog-rewrite/).

I'm a Christian - I go to [Central Baptist
Church](https://www.centralbaptistchelmsford.org) in Chelmsford,
where I help run the website, and help run kids' groups.

You can find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/dominicrodger), or on
Twitter as [@dominicrodger](https://www.twitter.com/dominicrodger/).
